# Boolean Schema

Creating a boolean schema is really easy:

```ts
import { boolean } from '@bauke2112/invalidjs';

const schema = boolean();
```

In addition to its specific methods, it accepts all [`mixed`](https://github.com/kimon0202/invalid/blob/master/.github/docs/Mixed.md) methods.
