# Invalid-JS

Ivalid-JS is a Typescript-first schema validation library.

It is inspired by other validation libraries like [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup#readme) and [Joi](https://github.com/sideway/joi#readme). Ivalid-JS tries to solve some problems regarding code duplication in such libraries, while exposing a simple and familiar function chaining API.

With Invalid-JS, it is also possible to create custom schemas and custom validation logic really easily.
